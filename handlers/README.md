**Imports:**

In Go, the `import` keyword is used to import other packages into the current file. The packages you import provide code that you can use in your current file. Here's what each import in your file does:

- `"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"`: Gin is a web framework written in Go. It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster. You're using it to set up your server and handle HTTP requests and responses.
- `"net/http"`: This is a built-in Go package that provides HTTP client and server implementations. You're using it for the HTTP status codes (like `http.StatusOK`).
- `"strconv"`: This is a built-in Go package that provides functions to convert strings to and from other data types. You're using the `strconv.Atoi` function to convert a string to an integer.

**`c *gin.Context`:**

In each of your handler functions, you have a parameter `c *gin.Context`. This is a context object provided by Gin. It's a struct that includes several useful fields and methods that you can use to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Here are a few things you can do with it:

- `c.Param("id")`: This gets the value of a URL parameter. In your case, you're using it to get the user ID from the URL.
- `c.ShouldBindJSON(&user)`: This binds the JSON request body to a struct. You're using it to get the user data from the request body when creating or updating a user.
- `c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)`: This sends a JSON response with a status code. You're using it to send responses to the client.
